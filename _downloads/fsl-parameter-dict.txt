# This files encodes the layout of the FSL design matrix
# ------------------------------------------------------
#
# In FSL, the experimental design matrix that is saved on disk does not
# yet contain an intercept column. The command line function
# 'fsl2design' will add an intercept to the front of the matrix for you.
#
# Single values will mark positions in the matrix starting with 0.
# Multiple values will be interpreted as contrasts and filled with 0 up
# to the number of parameters.
#
# Average left is contained in the second column (column 1), average
# right is contained in the forth column (column 3), the third and fifth
# columns contain the derivatives of the second and third columns.
#
# You may add all contrasts of interest here and feed this file to
# fmrifit (recommended), but you may also add new contrasts to this list
# at a later stage in analysis, too.
#
# Comments start with #, blank lines are ignored.
