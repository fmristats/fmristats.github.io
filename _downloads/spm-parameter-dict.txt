# This files encodes the layout of the SPM design matrix
# ------------------------------------------------------
#
# In SPM, the experimental design matrix encodes the intercept in the
# last column. (Although the location of the intercept is ultimately
# arbitrary, this is very uncommon.) Average left is coded in the first
# column, average right in the second column.
#
# You may add all contrasts of interest here and feed this file to
# fmrifit (recommended), but you may also add new contrasts to this list
# at a later stage in analysis, too.
#
# Comments start with #, blank lines are ignored.
#
# Single values will mark positions in the matrix starting with 0.
# Multiple values will be interpreted as contrasts and filled with 0 up
# to the number of parameters.

intercept  : -1
left       : 0
