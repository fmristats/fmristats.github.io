Complete, transparent, and data-oriented fitting of FMRI models
===============================================================

All current approaches to the statistical analysis of functional
magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) data involve the application of
various preprocessing steps which alter the signal to noise ratio (SNR)
of the original data. Enhancing the SNR prior to a formal analysis,
though, shakes at primary principles of statistical decision making and
it will generally inflate the type I error of the analysis.

This is the first statistical software tool which implements the
*data-oriented method (DOM)* estimator for FMRI, a new and original
method for the statistical analysis of FMRI data of brain scans. The
method fits a weighted least squares model to points of a random vector
field. Without prior spacial smoothings, i.e. without altering the
original 4D-image, the method nevertheless results in smooth fits of the
underlying activation parameter fields. More importantly, though, the
method yields a trustworthy estimate of the uncertainty of the estimated
activation field for each subject in a study. The availability of these
uncertainty fields allows to model FMRI studies using random effects
meta regression techniques acknowledging the fact that (i) individual
subjects are random entities, and that (ii) the variability in the
estimated individual activation patterns varies across the brain and
between subjects.

Installation
------------

An easy way to install fmristats is to install Anaconda3_, a cross platform
distribution for data analysis and scientific computing, and then using pip_,
the "PyPA recommended tool for installing Python packages", to install
fmristats itself.

.. code:: shell

    % pip install fmristats

That's it. You should be good to go.
