Thresholding
------------

In :ref:`explorative`, we fitted a population model to the FMRI of a
sample of subjects from a right-handed, healthy population that
performed a word generating task. As a result, we obtained an estimate
of the to-be-expected, task related BOLD effect in that population:

.. math::

    \left(\hat Œ≤(x) : x‚ààM \right).

And we also obtained an estimate of the standard error of :math:`\hat Œ≤`
at each :math:`x‚ààM`, namely the field:

.. math::

    \Big( s(x) : x‚ààM \Big).

Now, we are interested in testing the set (or field) of hypothesis:

.. math::

    H_0(x): Œ≤(x) = 0 \qquad \text{versus} \qquad H_1(x): Œ≤(x) > 0

for every :math:`x‚ààM` and to find areas in the brain, say :math:`R ‚äÜ M`,
which contain the *true* and *biologically relevant* activations. If we
reject :math:`H_0(x)` at some :math:`x‚ààM`, we may say that ¬ªwe can
expect significant BOLD activation at :math:`x` in the population¬´.

The set

.. math::

    R := \{ x ‚àà M : \text{we reject $H_0(x)$} \}

is typically called the set of *discoveries* in a study.

Some notation
.............

+---------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
|                     | :math:`H_0` is accepted | :math:`H_0` is rejected |                Total   |
+---------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| :math:`H_0` is true |            :math:`U`    |               :math:`V` |            :math:`M_0` |
+---------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| :math:`H_0` is false|            :math:`T`    |               :math:`S` | :math:`M\setminus M_0` |
+---------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| Total               | :math:`R\setminus M`    |               :math:`R` |              :math:`M` |
+---------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+

The set :math:`M` is fixed and known. The set :math:`M_0` is fixed but
unknown. The sets :math:`U,V,T,S` and consequently also :math:`R` and
:math:`R\setminus M` are random. We call :math:`R` the *discoveries* in
a study, and :math:`V` the set of *false positives*. The aim is to find
criteria that result in a set :math:`R` such that :math:`R` consists
mainly of elements of :math:`S` but that only contains a very limited
number of elements from :math:`V`. To find a suitable :math:`R`, one
studies the test statistics field:

.. math::

    \left(t(x) : t(x) = \frac {\hat Œ≤(x)}{s(x)}, x‚ààM \right).

It is custom to define :math:`R` as an *excursion set* of the
t-statistics field, i.e. to find a suitable cut-off :math:`t_0` and
to define

.. math::

    R := \left(x‚ààM : t(x) ‚â• t_0 \right).

This chapter discusses different approaches for defining suitable
candidates for :math:`t_0`.

Load statistics
...............




Load the summary statistics from file and extract the t-test statistics
field and the task related BOLD effects:


.. code:: python

    from fmristats import *
    result     = load(path_to_population_result)
    tstatistic = result.get_tstatistic()
    bold       = result.get_parameter()




Strategies for thresholding
...........................

Nistats_ has some functionality that may help in detecting areas with
potentially relevant BOLD activation in an image.

.. _Nistats: https://nistats.github.io/


.. code:: python

    from nistats.thresholding import map_threshold







It is easy enough to export a fmristats' ``Image``-object to a
``Niilike``-object that Nistats_ can understand:


.. code:: python

    from fmristats.nifti import image2nii
    tnii = image2nii(tstatistic, nan_to_zero=True)
    
    # control the false positive rate:
    _, fpr = map_threshold(tnii, level=.05, height_control='fpr')
    
    # make a Bonferonni correction:
    _, bon = map_threshold(tnii, level=.05, height_control='bonferroni')
    
    # control the false discovery rate (Benjamini-Hochberg):
    _, fdr = map_threshold(tnii, level=.05, height_control='fdr')




Let us have a look at the estimated thresholds:


.. code:: python

    print("""
    Threshold (controlling FPR) : {:.2f}
    Threshold (Bonferonni)      : {:.2f}
    Threshold (controlling FDR) : {:.2f}""".format(
        fpr, bon, fdr))


.. code::

    
    Threshold (controlling FPR) : 1.64
    Threshold (Bonferonni)      : 4.99
    Threshold (controlling FDR) : 2.62
    



Some notes on each of the three thresholds.

False positive rate
###################

Controlling the *false positive rate (FPR)* is very liberal in assigning
significance to an area. The FPR is the proportion of falsely rejected
:math:`H_0` *within* the set of true :math:`H_0`. In signs:

.. math::

    FPR = \frac {ùîº\left(Œª(V)\right)} {Œª(M_0)}.

(Read :math:`Œª(V)` as ¬ªthe volume of :math:`V`. More precisely,
:math:`Œª` shall denote the Lebesgue measure.) Note that the actual data
you have observed don't even play a role in the construction of the
FPR-threshold; the threshold is simply identical to:


.. code:: python

    
    from scipy.stats.distributions import norm
    print(norm.isf(0.05))


.. code::

    1.6448536269514729
    



Controlling the FPR has the effect that even when there is **no**
activation in the brain, we would still claim :math:`5\%` of the brain's
area as significant. To quote Keith Worsley: ¬ªobviously unacceptable¬´
[#1]_.

.. [#1] The Geometry of Random Images (1996) Chance 9(1), 27-39.

Family wise error rate
######################

Bonferonni controls the *family wise error rate (FWER)* in a set of
hypothesis tests. Using the notation introduced at the beginning of the
chapter, the FWER is

.. math::

    FWER = P(V=‚àÖ).

Bonferonni's method intrinsically depends on the ¬ªnumber¬´ of hypothesis
that are tested. The Bonferonni threshold accounts for this number and
in our case this number is, well, infinite: The resolution at which we
have evaluate the test statistics field :math:`(t(x) : x‚ààM)` is --
although probably being a deliberate choice -- ultimately an arbitrary
choice. The resolution at which we have evaluated the :math:`t`-field in
this example is:


.. code:: python

    print(tstatistic.reference.describe())


.. code::

    
            Resolution (left to right):          2.00 mm
            Resolution (posterior to anterior):  2.00 mm
            Resolution (inferior to superior):   2.00 mm
            Diagonal of one voxel:               3.46 mm
            Volume of one voxel:                 8.00 mm^3
            Aspect 0 on 1:                       1.00
            Aspect 0 on 2:                       1.00
            Aspect 1 on 2:                       1.00
    



But we could also have chosen a different template at a different
resolution. If the resolution is increased, then so does the number of
hypothesis that Bonferonni would need to account for, and so will the
Bonferonni threshold. On the other hand, if we were to chose to
evaluated :math:`t` at a coarser resolution, the Bonferonni threshold
will drop. You can see this effect by artificially dropping the
resolution of the result field:


.. code:: python

    
    import numpy as np
    
    def bonferroni_at_grained_image(n, level=0.05):
        data = tstatistic.data[::n,::n,::n]
        n_voxels = np.isfinite(data).sum()
        return norm.isf(level / n_voxels)
    
    for n in range(1,6):
        print('Threshold {:n}: {:.2f}'.format(n, bonferroni_at_grained_image(n)))


.. code::

    Threshold 1: 4.99
    Threshold 2: 4.57
    Threshold 3: 4.31
    Threshold 4: 4.11
    Threshold 5: 3.96
    



The threshold drops with decreasing resolution and it will raise with
increasing resolution. A threshold that depends on the resolution? Yes.
Bonferonni-style thresholding of an image really makes no sense. The
concept simply does not apply to a family of hypothesis of intrinsically
infinite cardinality.

This does not have to be all too surprising: Let us assume that there
exits at least one :math:`x‚ààM` in the brain with true BOLD activation.
Then the continuity of the test statistics field :math:`t` will force
the set :math:`R` to have a non-trivial, positive extend around
:math:`x`. (This is true for any threshold :math:`t_0` with
:math:`t_0<t(x)` but also whenever :math:`x` does not lie at a peak in
:math:`t`.) But if :math:`R` is not a null-set, then the probability
that it contains at least one false positive can safely assumed to be
:math:`1`. (It is unlikely that our model matches reality in such
perfection that we could safely assume the opposite.) It follows indeed
:math:`FWER=1` almost surly -- no matter how you may chose the
threshold. In other words, whenever you are willing to report any area
as significant, the chance of making a family error is almost surly
:math:`1`. And to try to control an almost sure :math:`100\%` at
:math:`5\%` really makes no sense.

False discovery rate
####################

The *false discovery rate* measures the proportion of falsely rejected,
true :math:`H_0` among the set of *discoveries* :math:`R`. Using the
above notation, the FDR equals:

.. math::

    FDR = ùîº\left( \frac {Œª(V)} {Œª(R)} | Œª(R)‚â†0 \right) ‚ãÖ P(Œª(R)‚â†0).

Controlling the FDR -- for example with Benjamini-Hochberg -- does not
show this strange behaviour that we have just previously seen, when
feeding the method a coarser image:


.. code:: python

    
    from nistats.thresholding import fdr_threshold
    
    def fdr_at_grained_image(n, level=0.05):
        data = tstatistic.data[::n,::n,::n]
        data = data[np.isfinite(data)]
        return fdr_threshold(data, level)
    
    for n in range(1,6):
        print('Threshold {:n}: {:.2f}'.format(n, fdr_at_grained_image(n)))


.. code::

    Threshold 1: 2.62
    Threshold 2: 2.62
    Threshold 3: 2.63
    Threshold 4: 2.63
    Threshold 5: 2.65
    



As we can see, the threshold even increases mildly with decreasing
resolution. If we feed less information to the procedure, the threshold
is raised and not dropped. We may also expect the estimated threshold to
eventually converge if the resolution of the t-statistics field
increases further and to also become more accurate when supplied with
more data.

Note that Benjamini-Hochberg's procedure for controlling the FDR in
:math:`R` has really been constructed with having independent tests in
mind. If there exists any inter-dependencies between the tests (as it is
the case here), the upper bound that is produced by Benjamini-Hochberg
becomes conservative. When using Bonferonni-Hochberg to control the FDR
in :math:`R`, we can probably safely assume that the actual FDR is
likely much smaller.

Get summary statistics
......................

The FDR is usually controlled at :math:`1\%` and not :math:`5\%`.


.. code:: python

    
    level         = 0.01
    threshold     = fdr_threshold(tstatistic.ravel(), level)
    active_volume = tstatistic.mask(tstatistic.data > threshold, inplace=False).volume()
    null_volume   = level*active_volume
    
    components, labels = tstatistic.components(threshold)
    
    print("""
    Volume claimed active:                          {:>9.2f} mm^3
    Upper bound of falsely discovered volume (FDV): {:>9.2f} mm^3
    Upper bound of false discovery rate (FDR):      {:>9.2f} %
    Bonferonni-Hochberg threshold:                  {:>9.2f}
    Components in brain claimed active:             {:>9d}""".format(
        active_volume, null_volume, 100*level, threshold, len(labels)))


.. code::

    
    Volume claimed active:                           70000.00 mm^3
    Upper bound of falsely discovered volume (FDV):    700.00 mm^3
    Upper bound of false discovery rate (FDR):           1.00 %
    Bonferonni-Hochberg threshold:                       3.27
    Components in brain claimed active:                    97
    



We may also chose to control the FDR at :math:`1\%` and additionally
force that any area claimed as active must have a minimum extend of
:math:`100 \text{mm}^3` (this corresponds roughly to a ball with radius
:math:`2.88 \text{mm}`):


.. code:: python

    
    # note component_size is in mm^3 and **not** in number of voxel!
    components, labels = tstatistic.components(threshold, component_size=100)
    
    active_volume = components.volume()
    null_volume   = level*active_volume
    
    print("""
    Volume claimed active:                          {:>9.2f} mm^3

Plotting fields above a threshold

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pylab as pt
    from fmristats.plot import picture

Effects, coordinates, locations
...............................

Thresholding a (continuous) field at a specified cut-off results in
areas above the threshold which are path-wise connected components. Let
us now extract (i) the highest t-statistics peak in each component, (ii)
the  coordinates of each peak in MNI standard space, (iii) the BOLD
effect at each peak, and (iv) the structural region to which each of the
peak belongs.


.. code:: python

    
    from scipy.ndimage import label, maximum, maximum_position
    
    # Find the position of the highest peak within each labelled region:
    peaks = maximum_position(tstatistic.data, components.data, labels)
    
    # Find the coordinates of the peaks in MNI standard space:
    coordinates = tstatistic.reference.apply_to_index(peaks)
    
    # Get their significance (the height of the t-statistics field)
    tvalues = np.array([tstatistic.data[index] for index in peaks])
    
    # Get their task related BOLD effect
    bvalues = np.array([bold.data[index] for index in peaks])




Put everything together in a nice data frame:


.. code:: python

    
    from pandas import DataFrame
    
    dat = np.concatenate((peaks, coordinates,
        bvalues[:,None], tvalues[:,None]), axis=1)
    
    df = DataFrame(dat, columns=['i', 'j', 'k', 'x', 'y', 'z', \
        'BOLD', 't_statistic'])
    df.sort_values(by='t_statistic', ascending=False, inplace=True)
    df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
    print(df)

Introducing: the FMRI fountain
..............................

In many high-throughput sciences it has become customary to visualise
potential discoveries in the form of volcano plots. A volcano plot shows
the observed effects (as a surrogate for the biological significance) on
the x-axis and a transformation of the respective p-values of the
effects (as a surrogate for statistical significance) on the y-axis. Let
us create such a plot for the peaks of the t-statistics field. Note that
as we are only looking ¬ªinto one direction¬´, the plot will look more
like a *fountain* rather than a volcano.

The following plot shows the estimated, task related BOLD effect of all
peaks in the entire t-statistic field in ATI units on the x-axis, and
the :math:`-log_{10}(p)` of the respective p-value of this effect on the
y-axis. The horizontal dashed line shows the Bonferonni-Hochberg
threshold. We may assume that the proportion of false discoveries above
the dashed line is below :math:`1\%`. The highest peak in each connected
component in the FDR-thresholded image is marked by a star. The
components with a minimal extent of :math:`100 \text{mm}^3` are
coloured.


.. code:: python

    
    # extract peaks of the entire field
    peakmap = tstatistic.detect_peaks()
    
    # t-values, effect estimates, and transformed p-values
    all_tvalues = tstatistic.data[peakmap.data]
    all_bvalues = bold.data[peakmap.data]
    
    # transformed t-statistics
    all_pt = -np.log10(norm.sf(all_tvalues))
    df ['pt'] = -np.log10(norm.sf(df.t_statistic))
    
    # height of Bonferonni-Hochberg threshold
    fdrline = -np.log10(level)
    
    pt.close()
    fig, ax = pt.subplots(figsize=(8,8))
    ax.axhline(fdrline, ls='--', c='k', lw=.9)
    ax.scatter(all_bvalues, all_pt, marker='.', c='k')
    
    # highest peak in each connected component
    for entry in df.itertuples():
        ax.scatter(entry.BOLD, entry.pt, marker='*')
    
    # location of top five entries in the discoveries
    for entry in df[:3].itertuples():
        ax.text(entry.BOLD, entry.pt, entry.location,
            horizontalalignment='right', verticalalignment='bottom')
    entry = df.iloc[3]
    ax.text(entry.BOLD, entry.pt, entry.location,
        horizontalalignment='left', verticalalignment='top')
    for entry in df[4:5].itertuples():
        ax.text(entry.BOLD, entry.pt, entry.location,
            horizontalalignment='right', verticalalignment='bottom')

In particular the exposed position of the top right discoveries suggest
high reliability.

We also see in the plot that there is a peak in the brain that shows a
strong BOLD effect with high suggested statistical significance that
either lies within a component that is smaller than our originally,
forced :math:`100 \text{mm}^3` threshold or within a component with a
more prominent peak.
