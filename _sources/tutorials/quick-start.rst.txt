Semi-Automated Analysis of Multiple Subjects
--------------------------------------------

fmristats provides a variety of command line tools which allow access to most
of its functionality. In particular when it comes to fitting a particular
signal model to subject data.

Before you start, a small but important warning: more »traditional« approaches
to FMRI data analysis recommend or encourage user to first spatially smooth
data prior to the statistical data analysis and to apply motion or slice timing
corrections. In fmristats, spatial smoothing is an integral part of the model
fitting process itself. Therefore, when using fmristats, you should **NOT alter
your images. DO NOT DO motion corrections. DO NOT DO correct for slice timing
differences. DO NOT smooth your data.** Your statistical analysis benefit from
more power this way and you will be rewarded with valid test statistics.

Protocol interface for large studies
....................................

Needless to say, fmristats allows to fit models to data one subject at a
time. If the plan, though, is to fit the data of multiple FMRI sessions
in a semi-automatic way, fmristats provides its so-called *protocol
interface*. The interface works with two files: a protocol file and a
covariates file (although it is possible for these two files to be one
and the same file).

The protocol file contains basic information *about the FMRI sessions*
in a study, the covariates file information *about the subjects* in the
study.

Both files are provided to fmristats as a pickled DataFrame_. Thus, you
have all the powers of Pandas_ at you disposal. fmristats, though, does
provide an interface for csv files, too.

Protocol files
::::::::::::::

Have a look at the first five lines of an example *protocol.csv*:

.. code:: shell

    head -n5 protocol.csv

.. code:: shell

    cohort,id,date,paradigm,valid,epi
    FOOBAR,1,2014-04-22,FP,True,3
    FOOBAR,2,2014-04-24,FP,True,3
    FOOBAR,3,2014-04-25,FP,True,3
    FOOBAR,4,2014-04-25,FP,True,3

We see, the first column contains a label for the cohort, here a study
labelled *FOOBAR*. (If your study only contains a single cohort, simply
name the cohort with the name of your study.) The second column contains
integer ids which uniquely identify a subject within its cohort. The
third column contains the time and date at which the FMRI session of the
respective subject has taken place. The forth column contains a short
token of the name of the FMRI paradigm used in this session. The column
`valid` indicates whether it can be assumed that this session contains
valid data or if this session should be excluded from the downstream
analysis. It may take one of two values: ``True`` or ``False``. If
`valid` is False, fmristats will exclude this measurement from the
study.

The last column, ``epi`` codes the direction in which the EPI in the
session have been measured. The epi codes are coded as follows:

==== =====================
epi  direction
==== =====================
-3   superior to inferior
-2   anterior to posterior
-1   right to left
 1   left to right
 2   posterior to anterior
 3   inferior to superior
==== =====================

If a subject has been measured multiple times, each FMRI session has its
own entry in the protocol file.

.. code:: shell

    cat protocol.csv | ag ,114,

.. code:: shell

    FOOBAR,114,2016-02-17,FP,True,3
    FOOBAR,114,2016-02-17,BP,False,3
    FOOBAR,114,2016-02-17,LT,True,3
    FOOBAR,114,2016-02-17,WGT,True,3
    FOOBAR,114,2016-02-17,Neglect,True,3
    FOOBAR,114,2016-02-17,Motion,True,3

Here, we see that subject 114 was measured six times with respect to
different FMRI paradigms labelled *FP*, *BP*, *LT*, *WGT*, *Neglect*,
and *Motion*. The session *BP* has been flagged invalid (here due to an
unfortunate error in the presentation software).

Creating a protocol file for fmristats from a csv file is easy:

.. code:: shell

    csv2protocol protocol.csv protocol.pkl --strftime short

This will save the protocol to ``protocol.pkl``. The option ``--strftime
short`` tells the parser that the date time strings  in ``protocol.csv``
do not contain *time* but only the date of the session. The option
``--strftime short`` is equivalent to ``--strftime '%Y-%m-%d'``. The
default, though, is ``--strftime '%Y-%m-%d-%H%M'``.

Have a look at the first ten entries:

.. code:: shell

    fmriprotocol protocol.pkl --head 10

.. code:: shell

                                   cohort  id       date paradigm  valid  epi
    cohort id paradigm date
    FOOBAR 1  BP       2014-04-22  FOOBAR   1 2014-04-22       BP   True    3
              FP       2014-04-22  FOOBAR   1 2014-04-22       FP   True    3
              LT       2014-04-22  FOOBAR   1 2014-04-22       LT   True    3
              Neglect  2014-04-22  FOOBAR   1 2014-04-22  Neglect   True    3
              WGT      2014-04-22  FOOBAR   1 2014-04-22      WGT   True    3
           2  BP       2014-04-24  FOOBAR   2 2014-04-24       BP   True    3
              FP       2014-04-24  FOOBAR   2 2014-04-24       FP   True    3
              LT       2014-04-24  FOOBAR   2 2014-04-24       LT   True    3
              Neglect  2014-04-24  FOOBAR   2 2014-04-24  Neglect   True    3
              WGT      2014-04-24  FOOBAR   2 2014-04-24      WGT   True    3

As you can see, fmristats will generate an index and sort the index,
too. An example on how to export the protocol file back to csv but only
keep the *WGT* sessions of the first 100 subjects:

.. code:: shell

    fmriprotocol protocol.pkl \
        --cohort FOOBAR --id 1 100 \
        --paradigm WGT \
        --to-csv test.csv -f

Covariate files
:::::::::::::::

In contrast, the covariate file contains information about the subjects
under study, such as *age*, *sex*, case/control *status*, or
*handedness*. Again, have a look at the first five lines of an example
covariate file:

.. code:: shell

    head -n5 covariate.csv

.. code:: shell

    cohort,id,sex,age,waterloo,valid
    FOOBAR,1,female,23,-67.0,False
    FOOBAR,2,female,24,49.0,True
    FOOBAR,3,female,25,37.0,True
    FOOBAR,4,male,26,59.0,True

We see that subject 2 is a right-handed 24 year old female with a
`Waterloo Handedness Score`_ of 49. Again, there exists a column *valid*
in the data table indicating whether a subject should be included or
excluded from downstream analysis. Here, subject 1 has been flagged as
invalid due to incompliance of the subject to the study protocol. The
column ``valid`` is optional, and will be set to ``True`` by default.

Creating a covariate file for fmristats from a csv file is easy:

.. code:: shell

    csv2covariate covariate.csv covariate.pkl

Have a look at the first five entries:

.. code:: shell

    fmricovariate covariate.pkl --head 5

.. code:: shell

                   sex   age  waterloo valid
    cohort id
    FOOBAR 1    female  23.0     -67.0  True
           2    female  24.0      49.0  True
           3    female  25.0      37.0  True
           4      male  26.0      59.0  True
           5    female  23.0      44.0  True

Export the file back to csv but only keep the right handed subjects:

.. code:: shell

    fmricovariate covariate.pkl \
        --query 'waterloo > 0' \
        --to-csv test.csv -f

The idea is that the covariate file may be maintained *independent* of
the respective study protocol file. Say, FMRI session data for a subject
is available and there would be no doubt in the quality of the data
(thus, one would want to include the subject in a study) but meanwhile
the subject had to be excluded from the study (say due to false
statements by the subject). Instead of going through the whole protocol
and marking each FMRI session of the subject as invalid, you may work
with a *master file* instead, and every time, just prior to performing
any population inference, you update your sample:

.. code:: shell

    csv2covariate masterfile.csv masterfile.pkl

    fmriprotocol protocol.pkl \
        --update masterfile.pkl \
        --output ../results/sample.pkl

Assuming that each subject in a study is not only measured once and not
only with respect to one single paradigm, fmristats recommends to work
with two separate files.

Defining a sample for population inference
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Say, we are interested in language processing in a simple word
generation task (*WGT*) in a right-handed population (say with a
`Waterloo Handedness Score`_ above 20), we select the respective sample
from the pool of available subject as:

.. code:: shell

    csv2covariate masterfile.csv masterfile.pkl

    fmriprotocol protocol.pkl \
        --paradigm WGT \
        --update masterfile.pkl covariate.pkl \
        --query  'waterloo > 20' \
        --output ../results/sample.pkl \
        --verbose --head 10 -f

Default file layout
...................

As long as you are not changing the defaults, fmristats will assume
the following file layout:

.. code:: shell

    path/to/study/
    ├── raw
    │   ├── mat
    │   │   └── PARADIGM_TOKEN
    │   │       ├── …
    │   │       ├── files.mat
    │   │       ├── …
    │   └── nii
    │       └── PARADIGM_TOKEN
    │           ├── …
    │           ├── files.nii.gz
    │           ├── …
    ├── results
    └── tables
        ├── covariates.csv
        └── protocol.csv

Say, FMRI data of a paradigm called WGT had been converted from DICOM to
the Nifti1 format using the dcm2nii_ tool with (essentially) all the
default settings:

- 4D=1: "will generate 4D files (FSL style)",
- SingleNIIFile=1: "will create .nii files (FSL style)",
- Gzip=1: "will create compressed .nii.gz files (FSL style)",
- SPM2=0: "headers will be in NIfTI (SPM5/FSL)."

.. _dcm2nii: http://people.cas.sc.edu/rorden/mricron/dcm2nii.html

Then save the data to ``path/to/study/raw/nii/WGT/`` in the format:

    ``{study}-{id}-{paradigm}-{datetime}.nii.gz``.

As SPM is among the standard software tools for FMRI analysis, your
presentation software may be able to save all relevant information
concerning the *irritation* or *conditioning* of the subject in a
``.mat``-file as it is described in the `SPM Manual`_ on page 65 in the
section *Multiple conditions*. fmristats contains a parser for these
files, thus, you may save the files to ``path/to/study/mat/WGT`` in the
format:

    ``{study}-{id}-{paradigm}-{datetime}.mat``

At the end, your file hierarchy should (or may) look as follows:

.. _`SPM Manual`: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/manual.pdf

.. code:: shell

    path/to/study/
    ├── raw
    │   ├── mat
    │   │   └── WGT
    │   │       ├── FOOBAR-0001-WGT-2014-04-22.mat
    │   │       ├── FOOBAR-0002-WGT-2014-04-24.mat
    │   │       ├── FOOBAR-0003-WGT-2014-04-25.mat
    │   │       ├── FOOBAR-0004-WGT-2014-04-25.mat
    │   │       ├── …
    │   └── nii
    │       └── WGT
    │           ├── FOOBAR-0001-WGT-2014-04-22.nii

    │           ├── FOOBAR-0004-WGT-2014-04-25.nii

    └── tables
        ├── covariates.csv
        ├── covariates.pkl
        ├── protocol.pkl
        └── protocol.csv

Fit the signal model to all members of a sample
...............................................

Assuming you are in ``path/to/study/results/``, the following will fit
the signal model to the data of all entries in ``sample.pkl`` which are
marked as valid:

.. code:: shell

    # Create Irritation Designs
    mat2irr --protocol sample.pkl -v

    # Create Session Designs
    nii2ses --protocol sample.pkl -v --detect-foreground

    # Fit head movements
    fmririgid --protocol sample.pkl -v

    # Assessment of head tracking ability
    ref2plot --protocol sample.pkl -v

    # Create the *identity population map* for each subject
    fmripmap --protocol sample.pkl -v

    # Fit in subject reference space (resolution: (2 mm)^3)
    fmrifit --protocol sample.pkl --stimulus-block letter -v

Or, to be conform with the above example, we would need to add
``--strftime short`` to each call, as *time* is not part of the naming
scheme in the example.

.. code:: shell

    # Create Irritation Designs
    mat2irr --protocol sample.pkl -v --strftime short

    # Create Session Designs
    nii2ses --protocol sample.pkl -v --detect-foreground --strftime short

    # Fit head movements
    fmririgid --protocol sample.pkl -v --strftime short

    # Assessment of head tracking ability
    ref2plot --protocol sample.pkl -v --strftime short

    # Create the *identity population map* for each subject,
    # say in resolution: (2 mm)^3
    fmripmap --protocol sample.pkl -v --strftime short

    # Fit in subject reference space
    fmrifit --protocol sample.pkl --stimulus-block letter -v --strftime short

Then either

.. code:: shell

    # Prune parameter fields from none-brain areas
    fmriprune --protocol sample.pkl -v -p .6 --strftime short

or

.. code:: shell

    # Prune parameter fields from none-brain areas
    fsl4prune --protocol sample.pkl -v -p .6 --strftime short

Plot parameter fits
...................

fmristats has some very basic plotting capabilities:

.. code:: shell

    fit2plot --protocol sample.pkl -v
