Some notes on speed
-------------------

Currently, the software is a pure Python3 implementation building on top
of many well established packages such as Numpy and Scipy, which may
(depending on your installation) take advantage of LAPLACK and BLAST.
Speed is unfortunately nevertheless an issue of the current
implantation. On a Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4440 CPU @ 3.10GHz please allow
a minimum of 7h to fit a signal model to data of a 5 minute, 64x64x30
FMRI session. fmristats has some multiprocessor capabilities, though,
which allow to fit multiple subjects in parallel on as many cores which
you are able to spare. If you have access to 40 cores, you will also
only need 7h for 40 subjects.

The bottleneck in the program is known, and I plan to port the
respective part to C and also to move the calculation to the GPU. This
should speed the fitting by a factor of 1000. [#]_

Fitting the population model to the summary statistics is faster.
