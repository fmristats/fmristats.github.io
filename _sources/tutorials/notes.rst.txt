Some notes on speed
-------------------

On a Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4440 CPU @ 3.10GHz with 4 cores the fit a
signal model to data of an approximately 5 minute long FMRI session (230
scan cycles, 30 slices, 64x64 in-plane resolution) takes approximately:
4h 15min.

Fitting the population model is faster.
