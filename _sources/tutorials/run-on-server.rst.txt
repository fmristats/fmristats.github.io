Run analysis on a server
------------------------

You have created the session files, estimated the head movements (aka.\
reference maps), and the diffeomorphisms mapping form standard space to
the respective subject spaces (aka.\ population maps). What is missing,
now: you would like to fit the subject model to the FMRI of each subject
but you don't have enough resources on your local hardware. Solution:
move the stuff to a server.

On your computer, your data tree will thus far look as follows:

.. code:: shell

    data
    ├── irr
    ├── pop
    ├── ref
    ├── ses
    └── vbs
        ├── MNI152_T1_2mm_brain.image
        └── MNI152_T1_2mm.image

What you need at minimum on the host computer in order to run the
analysis:

.. code:: shell

    data
    ├── pop
    ├── ref
    ├── ses
    └── vbs
        ├── MNI152_T1_2mm_brain.image
        └── MNI152_T1_2mm.image

Solution: copy the tree to the host server:

.. code:: shell

    scp -r data username@hostname:~/path/to/project

Also copy the sample, you would like to analyse:

.. code:: shell

    scp -r results/mysample.pkl username@hostname:~/path/to/project/results

Then log in to the server and run the analysis:

.. code:: shell

    ssh hostname

    cd ~/path/to/project/results

    fmrifit --protocol mysample.pkl -v --strftime short \
        --stimulus-block letter \
        --vb mni152 --diffeomorphism ants

The advantage is that none of the software that you have needed to
create the population maps (such as ANTS, FSL, or SPM) is needed on the
server side. Just fmristats.
