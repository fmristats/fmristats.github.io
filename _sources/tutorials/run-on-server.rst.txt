Run the analysis on a server
----------------------------

You have created the session files, estimated the head movements (the
reference maps), and the diffeomorphisms mapping form standard space to
the respective subject reference spaces (the population maps). Now you
would like to fit a FMRI signal model to the data of each subject but
you don't have enough resources on your local hardware. Solution: Move
your calculations to a server.

The following will copy all necessary files to the server:

.. code:: shell

    rsync -avuz -n \
        --include '**/*.session' \
        --include '**/*.rigids' \
        --include '**/*.popmap' \
        --include 'tutorial.study' \
        results username@hostserver:~/path/to/

Or equivalently:

.. code:: shell

    rsync -avuz -n \
        --include '**/*.session' \
        --include '**/*.rigids' \
        --include '**/*.popmap' \
        --include 'tutorial.study' \
        results/ username@hostserver:~/path/to/results

Now, you can log in and run ``fmrifit``. After the calculations are
finished, pull the results back to your machine:

.. code:: shell

    rsync -avuz -n \
        --include '**/*.fit' \
        username@hostserver:~/path/to/results .

Or equivalently:

.. code:: shell

    rsync -avuz -n \
        --include '**/*.fit' \
        username@hostserver:~/path/to/results/ results

The advantage is that none of the software that was needed to create the
population maps (such as ANTS_, AFNI_, FSL_, or SPM_) is needed on the
server side. Just fmristats.
